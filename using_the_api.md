# The USAspending Application Programming Interface (API)

The USAspending API allows the public to access data published via the DATA Act Data Broker or via USAspending. While the API is under development, we are gradually increasing the amount of available data, which is currently limited to a few Data Broker submissions and small slices of USAspending history.

## Background <a name="background"></a>

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is building a suite of open-source tools to help federal agencies comply with the [DATA Act](http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/about/ "Federal Spending Transparency Background") and to deliver the resulting standardized federal spending information back to agencies and to the public.

For more information about the DATA Act Broker codebase, please visit this repository's [main README](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/data-act-broker-backend/README.md "DATA Act Broker Backend README").

## DATA Act Data Store Endpoint Documentation

Endpoints do not currently require any authorization.

### Status Codes <a name="status-codes"></a>
In general, status codes returned are as follows:

* 200 if successful
* 400 if the request is malformed
* 500 for server-side errors

### Data Endpoints <a name="data-endpoints"></a>

Data endpoints are split by payload into POST and GET methods. In general, the format of a request and response will remain the same among endpoints.

#### Endpoints and Methods <a name="endpoints-and-methods"></a>
The currently available endpoints are listed below. To reduce unnecessary data transfer, most return a default set of information about the items being requested. To override the default field list, use the `fields`, `exclude`, and `verbose` options (see [POST Requests](#post-requests) for more information).

  * **[/v1/accounts/](https://spending-api.us/api/v1/accounts/)**
    - _Description_: Provides financial information by appropriations account. Financial information is data such as total budget authority, outlays, obligations, and unobligated balance. _Note_: This endpoint is due for a rework in the near future.
    - _Methods_: GET, POST


  * **[/v1/accounts/tas/](https://spending-api.us/api/v1/accounts/tas/)**
    - _Description_: Returns a list of appropriations accounts, including the account name, Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) components, the associated budget function, and the corresponding agency information. _Note_: This endpoint is due for a rework in the near future.
    - _Methods_: GET, POST


  * **[/v1/awards/](https://spending-api.us/api/v1/awards/)**
    - _Description_: Provides a list of awards. Award data pertains to grants, loans, direct payments to individuals, and contracts.
    - _Methods_: GET, POST


  * **/v1/awards/{pk}**
    - _Description_: Provides information about a single award. Unlike the awards list endpoint (`/awards`), this one returns all available fields instead of the default set. The value for `{pk}` is the `id` field returned in the `/awards/` response.
    - _Methods_: GET, POST


  * **/v1/awards/autocomplete/**
      - _Description_: Provides a fast endpoint for evaluating autocomplete queries against the awards endpoint.
    - _Methods_: POST


  * **[/v1/transactions/](https://spending-api.us/api/v1/transactions/)**

    - _Methods_: GET, POST


  * **/v1/transactions/{pk}**
    - _Description_: Provides information about a single transaction. Unlike the transaction list endpoint (`/transactions`), this one returns all available fields instead of the default set.
    - _Methods_: GET, POST


  * **/v1/references/locations/**
    - _Description_: Returns a list of locations. If a location's `recipient_flag` is set to true, it represents the location of award recipients like grantees and contractors. If its `place_of_performance_flag` is true, the location represents the place an award was executed. A single location can represent both a recipient and a place of performance.
    - _Methods_: POST


  * **/v1/references/locations/geocomplete/**

    - _Methods_: POST


  * **[/v1/submissions/](https://spending-api.us/api/v1/submissions/)**
    - _Description_: Returns metadata about submissions loaded from the DATA Act broker. _Note_: This endpoint is due for a rework in the near future.
    - _Methods_: GET, POST


#### Summary Endpoints and Methods <a name="summary-endpoints-and-methods"></a>
Summarized data is available for some of the endpoints listed above:

* **/v1/awards/total/**
* **/v1/transactions/total/**
* more coming soon

You can get summarized data via a `POST` request that specifies:

* `field`: the field to be summarized (this supports Django's foreign key traversal; for more details on this see `field` in [POST Requests](#post-requests)).
* `aggregate`: the aggregate function to use when summarizing the data (defaults to `sum`; `avg`, `count`, `min`, and `max` are also supported)
* `group`: the field to group by (optional; if not specified, data will be summarized across all objects)
* `date_part`: applies only when `group` is a data field and specifies which part of the date to group by; `year`, `month`, and `day` are currently supported, and `quarter` is coming soon

Requests to the summary endpoints can also contain the `filters` parameters as described in [POST Requests](#post-requests). **Note:** If you're filtering the data, the filters are applied before the data is summarized.

The `results` portion of the response will contain:

* `item`: the value of the field in the request's `group` parameter (if the request did not supply `group`, `item` will not be included)
* `aggregate`: the summarized data

To order the response by the items being returned via the `group` parameter, you can specify an `order` in the request: `"order": ["item"]`. To order the response by the aggregate values themselves, add `"order": ["aggregate]` to the request.

For example, to request the yearly sum of obligated dollars across transactions for award types "B" and "C" (_i.e._, purchase orders and delivery orders) and to ensure that the response is ordered by year:

POST request to `/transactions/total`:

```json
{
    "field": "federal_action_obligation",
    "group": "action_date",
    "date_part": "year",
    "aggregate": "sum",
    "order": ["item"],
    "filters": [
        {
            "field": "type",
            "operation": "in",
            "value": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
        }
     ]
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "total_metadata": {
    "count": 2
  },
  "page_metadata": {
    "page_number": 1,
    "num_pages": 1,
    "count": 2
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "item": "2015",
      "aggregate": "44948.00"
    },
    {
      "item": "2016",
      "aggregate": "1621763.83"
    }
  ]
}
```

To summarize a field using a foreign key and to order the response by the summarized values from highest to lowest:

POST request to `/awards/total`:

```json
{
    "field": "total_obligation",
    "group": "place_of_performance__state_code",
    "aggregate": "sum",
    "order": ["-aggregate"]
}
```
Response:

```json
{
  "page_metadata": {
    "num_pages": 1,
    "page_number": 1,
    "count": 4
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "item": "MO",
      "aggregate": "500000.00"
    },
    {
      "item": "DC",
      "aggregate": "485795.43"
    },
    {
      "item": "UT",
      "aggregate": "0.00"
    },
    {
      "item": "HI",
      "aggregate": "-2891.33"
    }
  ],
  "total_metadata": {
    "count": 4
  }
}
```

#### Pagination <a name="pagination"></a>
To control the number of items returned on a single "page" of a request or to request a specific page number, use the following URL parameters:

* `page` - specifies the page of results to return. The default is 1.
* `limit` - specifies the maximum number of items to return in a response page. The default is 100.

For example, the following request will limit the awards on a single page to 20 and will return page 5 of the results:

`/v1/awards/?page=5&limit=20`

#### GET Requests <a name="get-requests"></a>
GET requests support simple equality filters for fields in the underlying data model. These can be specified by attaching field value pairs to the endpoint as URL parameters:

`/v1/awards?type=B`

Field names support Django's foreign key traversal; for more details on this see `field` in [POST Requests](#post-requests). For example:

`/v1/awards/?type=B&awarding_agency__toptier_agency__cgac_code=073`

#### POST Requests <a name="post-requests"></a>
The structure of the post request allows for a flexible and complex query.

#### Body (JSON)
Below is an example body for the `/v1/awards/?page=1&limit=200` POST request. The API expects the content in JSON format, so the requests's content-type header should be set to `application/json`.

```
{
    "verbose": true,
    "order": ["recipient__location__state_code", "-recipient__recipient_name"],
    "fields": ["fain", "total_obligation"],
    "exclude": ["recipient"],
    "filters": [
      {
        "field": "piid",
        "operation": "equals",
        "value": "SBAHQ16M0163"
      },
      {
        "combine_method": "OR",
        "filters": [ . . . ]
      }
    ]
}
```

#### Options

* `exclude` - _Optional_ - What fields to exclude from the return. Must be a list.
* `fields` - _Optional_ - What fields to return. Must be a list. Omitting this will return all fields.
* `order` - _Optional_ - Specify the ordering of the results. This should _always_ be a list, even if it is only of length one. It will order by the first entry, then the second, then the third, and so on in order. This defaults to ascending. To get descending order, put a `-` in front of the field name. For example, to sort descending on `awarding_agency__name`, put `-awarding_agency__name` in the list.
* `verbose` - _Optional_ - Endpoints that return lists of items (`/awards/` and `/accounts/`, for example) return a default list of fields. To instead return all fields, set this value to `true`. Note that you can also use the `fields` and `exclude` options to override the default field list. Default: false.
* `filters` - _Optional_ - An array of objects specifying how to filter the dataset. When multiple filters are specified in the root list, they will be joined via _and_
  * `field` - A string specifying the field to compare the value to. This supports Django's foreign key relationship traversal; therefore, `funding_agency__fpds_code` will filter on the field `fpds_code` for the referenced object stored in `funding_agency`.
  * `operation` - The operation to use to compare the field to the value. Some operations place requirements upon the data type in the values parameter, noted below. To negate an operation, use `not_`. For example, `not_equals` or `not_in`. The options for this field are:
    * `equals` - Evaluates the equality of the value with that stored in the field
      ```
      {
        "field": "fain",
        "operation": "equals",
        "value": "1234567"
      }
      ```
    * `less_than` - Evaluates whether the value stored in the field is less than the value specified in the filter
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "less_than",
      "value": 2000
    }
    ```
    * `less_than_or_equal` - As `less_than`, but inclusive
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "less_than_or_equal",
      "value": 100000
    }
    ```
    * `greater_than` - Evaluates whether the value stored in the field is greater than the value specified in the filter
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "greater_than",
      "value": 3.50
    }
    ```
    * `greater_than_or_equal` - As `greater_than`, but inclusive
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "greater_than_or_equal",
      "value": 20
    }
    ```
    * `in` - Evaluates if the value stored in the field is any of the values specified in the value parameter. `value` must be an array of values
    ```
    {
      "field": "recipient__name",
      "operation": "in",
      "value": [
          "DEPARTMENT OF LABOR",
          "HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT",
          "LEXCORP"
        ]
    }
    ```
    * `range` - Evaluates if the value stored in the field is in the range defined by a list specified in the value parameter. `value` must be an array of length two. The first value in the array will be treated as the start of the range.
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "range",
      "value": [250000, 1000000]
    }
    ```
    * `contains` - A case-insensitive containment test
    ```
    {
      "field": "recipient__name",
      "operation": "contains",
      "value": "BOEING"
    }
    ```
    * `is_null` - Evaluates if the field is null or not null. `value` must be either `true` or `false`
    ```
    {
      "field": "awarding_agency",
      "operation": "is_null",
      "value": false
    }
    ```
    * `search` - Executes a full text search on the specified field or fields
    ```
    {
      "field": "awarding_agency__name",
      "operation": "search",
      "value": "congress"
    }
    ```
    **_or_**
    ```
    {
      "field": ["awarding_agency__name", "recipient__name"]
      "operation": "search",
      "value": "treasury"
    }
    ```
    * `fy` - Evaluates if the field (generally should be a datetime field) falls within the federal fiscal year specified as `value`. `value` should be a 4-digit integer specifying the fiscal year. An example of a fiscal year is FY 2017 which runs from October 1st 2016 to September 30th 2017. Does not need `value_format` as it is assumed.
    ```
    {
      "field": "date_signed",
      "operation": "fy",
      "value": 2017
    }
    ```
    * `range_intersect` - Evaluates if the range defined by a two-field list intersects with the range defined
    by the two length array `value`. `value` can be a single item _only_ if `value_format` is also set to a
    range converting value. An example of where this is useful is when a contract spans multiple fiscal years, to evaluate whether it overlaps with any one particular fiscal year - that is, the range defined by `period_of_performance_start` to `period_of_performance_end` intersects with the fiscal year.

    For example, if your `field` parameter defines a range as `[3,5]` then the following ranges will intersect:
      * `[2,3]` - As the 3 overlaps
      * `[4,4]` - As the entire range is contained within another
      * `[0,100]` - As the entire range is contained within another
      * `[5,10]` - As the 5 overlaps

    Mathematically speaking, ranges will intersect as long as there exists some value `C` such that `r1 <= C <= r2` and `f1 <= C <= f2`
    ```
    {
      "field": ["create_date", "update_date"],
      "operation": "range_intersect",
      "value": ["2016-11-01", "2016-11-02"]
    }
    ```
    **_or_**
    ```
    {
      "field": ["create_date", "update_date"],
      "operation": "range_intersect",
      "value": 2017,
      "value_format": "fy"
    }
    ```
  * `value` - Specifies the value to compare the field against. Some operations require specific datatypes for the value, and they are documented in the `operation` section.
  * `value_format` - Specifies the format for the value. Only used in some operations where noted. Valid choices are enumerated below
    * `fy` - Treats a single value as a fiscal year range
  * `combine_method` - This is a special field which modifies how the filter behaves. When `combine_method` is specified, the only other allowed parameter on the filter is `filters` which should contain an array of filter objects. The `combine_method` will be used to logically join the filters in this list. Options are `AND` or `OR`.
  ```
  {
			"combine_method": "OR",
			"filters": [
				{
					"field": "funding_agency__fpds_code",
					"operation": "equals",
					"value": "0300"

				},
				{
					"field": "awarding_agency__fpds_code",
					"operation": "in",
					"value": ["0300", "0500"]

				}
				]

	}
  ```

#### Response (JSON)

### Response Description
The response has three functional parts:
  * `page_metadata` - Includes data about the pagination and any page-level metadata specific to the endpoint
    * `page_number` - What page is currently being returned
    * `num_page` - The number of pages available for this set of filters
    * `count` - The length of the `results` array for this page
  * `total_metadata` - Includes data about the total dataset and any dataset-level metadata specific to the endpoint
    * `count` - The total number of items in this dataset, spanning all pages
  * `results` - An array of objects corresponding to the data returned by the specified endpoint. Will _always_ be an array, even if the number of results is only one.


### Autocomplete Queries <a name="autocomplete-queries"></a>
Autocomplete queries currently require the endpoint to have additional handling, as such, only a few have been implemented (notably `/awards/`).

#### Body
```
{
	fields": ["toptier_agency__name", "subtier_agency__name"],
	"value": "DEFENSE",
	"mode": "contains",
    "limit": 100,
    "matched_objects": true
}
```
#### Options
  * `fields` - A list of fields to be searched for autocomplete. This allows for foreign key traversal using the usual Django patterns. This should _always_ be a list, even if the length is only one
  * `value` - The value to use as the autocomplete pattern. Typically a string, but could be a number in uncommon circumstances. The search will currently _always_ be case insensitive
  * `mode` - _Optional_ - The search mode. Options available are:
    * `contains` - Matches if the field's value contains the specified value
    * `startswith` - Matches if the field's value starts with the specified value
  * `matched_objects` - _Optional_ - Boolean value specifying whether or not to return matching data objects. Default: false
  * `limit` - _Optional_ - Limits the number of query matches. Defaults to 10.
