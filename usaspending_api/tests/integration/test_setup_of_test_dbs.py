This module should contain only the one test.
It is to be called by name as the singular test in a pytest session, and used to trigger the setup of the test
database(s) for the NEXT run of pytest. Both invocations should use the --reuse-db option to leave behind and pick
back up the test datbase(s).
It can conveniently and efficiently pre-establish MULTIPLE test databases using pytest-xdist for parallel test sessions
run by multiple workers. For this case, both invocations of pytest should use the same pytest-xdist value for the
number of workers (the value of -n or --numprocesses)
