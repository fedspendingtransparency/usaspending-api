In this section you will find definitions for common terms used in the API. For detailed explanations of specific fields, please see that endpoint's entry in the Endpoint Details section.

| Term | Explanation |
| ----- | ----- |
|Agency|	On this website we use the term agency to mean any federal department, agency, office, or other U.S. government entity.|
|Agency Identifier|	Identifies the agency responsible for a Treasury account. This is a 1-3 digit number that is a part of a Treasury Account Symbol (TAS).|
|Allocation Transfer Agency (ATA) Identifier|	Identifies an agency that receives funds through an allocation (non-expenditure) transfer. This is a 1-3 digit number that is a part of a Treasury Account Symbol (TAS).|
|Appropriation Account|	When Congress passes a law, it often gives an agency authority to carry out a project. When this happens, Congress may set aside money for the project. An appropriation account tracks the money, much like a bank account.|
|Availability Type Code|	Within a Treasury Account Symbol (TAS), the code will have an "X" in it if there is an unlimited period to incur new obligations. The &ldquo;X&rdquo; is called the Availability Type Code.|
|Award|	Money the federal government has promised to pay a recipient. Funding may be awarded to a company, organization, or individual. It may be obligated (promised) in the form of a contract, grant, loan, or direct payment.|
|Award Amount|	The amount that the federal government has promised to pay a recipient, either now or in the future. An award amount includes option years which have not yet been exercised. For example, if a recipient is promised a $10M on a base contract with 3 option years at $1M each, the award amount is $13M.|
|Award Ceiling|	The maximum amount of money that the government may pay a recipient. For a contract, this total includes the base amount plus the amounts of all possible options.|
|Award ID|	A unique identification number for each individual award. An award may be a contract, grant, loan, direct payment, purchase order, or blanket purchase agreement.|
|Award Type|	The mechanism used to distribute funding. The federal government can distribute funding in several forms. These award types include contracts, grants, loans, and direct payments.|
|Awarding Agency|	An Awarding Agency is the agency who agrees to pay a recipient. This agency usually pays for the funding out of its own budget. In rare cases, the money is financed by another agency, called the Funding Agency.|
|Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA)|	A BOA is a type of Indefinite Delivery Vehicle. It is not a contract; it is a written understanding between government and contractor. It details the supplies or services offered. It also details pricing and delivery for future orders. This agreement can speed contracting when requirements are uncertain. For instance, when specifications, quantities, and prices are not yet known. These agreements can also help the government achieve economies of scale for part orders. For the contractor, they can lessen lead-time, enable a larger inventory investment, and lessen old inventory.|
|Beginning Period of Availability|	Identifies the first year that an appropriation account may incur new obligations. This is for annual and multi-year funds only. This is a 2-digit number representing the year. For example, &ldquo;17&rdquo; means 2017. It is a part of a Treasury Account Symbol (TAS).|
|Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)|	A BPA is a method federal agencies use to make repeat purchases of supplies or services. A type of Indirect Delivery Vehicle, a BPA operates by essentially setting up a &ldquo;charge account&rdquo; with trusted vendors. Both agencies and vendors like BPAs because they help trim the red tape associated with repetitive purchasing. Once a BPA is set up, repeat purchases are easy for both sides. A BPA is an agreement with an individual agency, meaning only a handful of offices can place orders on a BPA. A BPA can be awarded to a set of vendors, who will then be able to bid on upcoming orders. A BPA can be set up with or without GSA schedules. Without GSA schedules, orders are capped at the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) of $100,000. <br/>Examples of BPAs: <br/>- Agency A establishes a BPA with a computer manufacturer for repeat laptop purchases<br/>- Agency B establishes a BPA with a graphic design agency for design of brochures and event signage
|
|Budget Function|	The federal budget is divided into 19 categories known as budget functions. These categories organize federal spending into topics based on the major purpose the spending serves (e.g., National Defense, Transportation, Health). These are further broken down into budget subfunctions.|
|Budget Subfunction| The federal budget is divided into functions and subfunctions. These categories organize federal spending into topics based on the major purpose the spending serves. There are 19 major functions (e.g., National Defense, Transportation, Health). Most of these functions are further divided into subfunctions. For example, the budget function for Health (500) is divided into subfunctions for Health care services (551), Health research and training (552), and Consumer and occupational health and safety (554).|

|FAIN|	An identification code assigned to each financial assistance award tracking purposes. The FAIN is tied to that award (and all future modifications to that award) throughout the award&rsquo;s life. Each FAIN is assigned by an agency. Within an agency, FAIN are unique: each new award must be issued a new FAIN. FAIN stands for Federal Award Identification Number, though the digits are letters, not numbers.|

|Federal Supply Schedule (FSS)|	A listing of contractors that have been awarded a contract by GSA that can be used by all Federal agencies. This is also known as a Multiple Award Schedule (MAS).|
|Federal Assistance|	A federal program, service, or activity that directly aids organizations, individuals, or state/local/tribal governments. Sectors include education, health, public safety and public welfare - to name a few. It can be in the form of a grant, loan, or insurance.|
|Fiscal Year (FY)|	The fiscal year is an accounting period that spans 12 months. For the federal government, it runs from October 1 to September 30. For example, Fiscal Year 2017 (FY 2017) starts October 1, 2016 and ends September 30, 2017. A fiscal year may be broken down into quarters. For the federal government, these quarters are:<br/>Q1: October - December<br/>Q2: January - March<br/>Q3: April - June<br/>Q4: July - September|"
|Funding Agency|	A Funding Agency pays for the majority of funds for an award out of its budget. Typically, the Funding Agency is the same as the Awarding Agency. In some cases, one agency will present an award (Awarding Agency) and another agency will pay for it (Funding Agency).|
|Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC)|	This is a multi-agency contract. It offers Information Technology (IT) services to agencies across the government. It is an Indefinite Delivery Vehicle for certain types of IT work:<br/>- Systems design<br/>- Software engineering<br/>- Information assurance<br/>- Enterprise architecture<br/>Vendors compete for the initial contracts.
