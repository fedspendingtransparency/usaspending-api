###### Announcement
The USASpending API is in V2. V1 endpoints are currently Deprecated.

# The USAspending Application Programming Interface (API)

The USAspending API (Application Programming Interface) allows the public to access comprehensive U.S. government spending data.

The data include spending on _awards_ (_e.g._, who received federal contracts or grants, geographic breakdowns, agency breakdowns, and much more). The data also include account-level, non-award spending such as federal employee compensation. You can learn more about the data and the federal law that requires it to be publicly accessible (the DATA Act) at http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

**New to APIs?** Check out our [introductory tutorial](/docs/intro-tutorial) on the API to learn the ropes.

**New to government financial data?** Check out our [data dictionary](/docs/data-dictionary) to learn to navigate it.

## Background <a name="background"></a>

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is building a suite of open-source tools to help federal agencies comply with the [DATA Act](http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/about/ "Federal Spending Transparency Background") and to deliver the resulting standardized federal spending information back to agencies and to the public.

For more information about the USAspending API codebase, please visit this repository's [main README](https://github.com/fedspendingtransparency/usaspending-api/blob/master/README.md "USAspending API README").
