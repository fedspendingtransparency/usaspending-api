## Autocomplete Endpoints
**Route:** `/api/v2/autocomplete/...`

**Method:** `POST`

Autocomplete endpoints are used to return possible Database results based on a user's string input.  

These features are used by the usaspending.gov/#/search page to populate filters. For example, if you type in a recipient name, the results are populated by autocomplete endpoints.
