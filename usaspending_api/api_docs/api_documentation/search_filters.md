# Search Filters v2 Documentation

**NOTE:** Filter examples can be combined into a single object in order to AND their results. Some search filters can be OR'd internally and will be specified as such. For example:

```
{
    "keywords": ["example search text"],
    "time_period": [
        {
            "start_date": "2001-01-01",
            "end_date": "2001-01-31"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Standard Location Object

```
