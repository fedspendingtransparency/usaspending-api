# Using the USAspending Application Program Interface (API) <a name="introduction"></a>

The USAspending API allows the public to access data published via the DATA Act Data Broker and USAspending.

This guide is intended for users who are already familiar with APIs. If you're not sure what _endpoint_ means, and what `GET` and `POST` requests are, you'll probably find the [introductory tutorial](/docs/intro-tutorial) more useful.

The USAspending API is in V2. V1 endpoints are currently deprecated.






#### GET Requests <a name="get-requests"></a>
GET requests support simple equality filters for fields in the underlying data model. Specify these by attaching field value pairs to the endpoint as URL parameters:

`/v1/awards?type=B`

Field names support Django's foreign key traversal; for more details on this see `field` in [POST Requests](#post-requests). For example:

`/v1/awards/?type=B&awarding_agency__toptier_agency__toptier_code=073`

#### POST Requests <a name="post-requests"></a>
The structure of a POST request allows for a flexible and complex query.

#### POST Request Preservation <a name="post-requests-preservation"></a>
All requests will return a `req` object in their response. This code allows you to share and preserve POST requests from page to page. You can send a request to any endpoint and specify the `req` from any request to re-run that request. For example, if you sent a POST request to `/api/v1/awards/` and returned a `req` of `abcd` you could re-run that request by hitting:

`/api/v1/awards/?req=abcd`

Or by POSTing
```
{
  "req": "abcd"
}
```

Do note that this _ignores_ pagination variables, so you can request a different page from the same request without changing your `req`. For example:

`/api/v1/awards/?req=abcd&page=2`

Or by POSTing
```
{
  "page": 2,
  "req": "abcd"
}
```
You would get the second page of the previous request.

#### Body (JSON)
The following is an example body for the `/v1/awards/?page=1&limit=200` POST request. The API expects the content in JSON format, so the request's content-type header should be set to `application/json`.

```
{
    "verbose": true,
    "order": ["recipient__location__state_code", "-recipient__recipient_name"],
    "fields": ["fain", "total_obligation"],
    "exclude": ["recipient"],
    "filters": [
      {
        "field": "piid",
        "operation": "equals",
        "value": "SBAHQ16M0163"
      },
      {
        "combine_method": "OR",
        "filters": [ . . . ]
      }
    ]
}
```

#### Options

* `exclude` - _Optional_ - What fields to exclude from the return. Must be a list.
* `fields` - _Optional_ - What fields to return. Must be a list. Omitting this will return all fields.
* `order` - _Optional_ - Specify the ordering of the results. This should _always_ be a list, even if it is only of length one. It will order by the first entry, then the second, then the third, and so on in order. This defaults to ascending. To get descending order, put a `-` in front of the field name. For example, to sort descending on `awarding_agency__name`, put `-awarding_agency__name` in the list.
* `verbose` - _Optional_ - Endpoints that return lists of items `/awards/` and `/accounts/`, for example return a default list of fields. To instead return all fields, set this value to `true`. Note that you can also use the `fields` and `exclude` options to override the default field list. Default: false.
* `filters` - _Optional_ - An array of objects specifying how to filter the dataset. When multiple filters are specified in the root list, they will be joined via _and_.
  * `field` - A string specifying the field to compare the value to. This supports Django's foreign key relationship traversal; therefore, `funding_agency__toptier_code` will filter on the field `toptier_code` for the referenced object stored in `funding_agency`.
  * `operation` - The operation to use to compare the field to the value. Some operations place requirements upon the data type in the values parameter, noted below. To negate an operation, use `not_`. For example, `not_equals` or `not_in`. The options for this field are:
    * `equals` - Evaluates the equality of the value with that stored in the field.
      ```
      {
        "field": "fain",
        "operation": "equals",
        "value": "1234567"
      }
      ```
    * `less_than` - Evaluates whether the value stored in the field is less than the value specified in the filter.
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "less_than",
      "value": 2000
    }
    ```
    * `less_than_or_equal` - As `less_than`, but inclusive
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "less_than_or_equal",
      "value": 100000
    }
    ```
    * `greater_than` - Evaluates whether the value stored in the field is greater than the value specified in the filter.
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "greater_than",
      "value": 3.50
    }
    ```
    * `greater_than_or_equal` - As `greater_than`, but inclusive
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "greater_than_or_equal",
      "value": 20
    }
    ```
    * `in` - Evaluates if the value stored in the field is any of the values specified in the value parameter. `value` must be an array of values.
    ```
    {
      "field": "recipient__name",
      "operation": "in",
      "value": [
          "DEPARTMENT OF LABOR",
          "HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT",
          "LEXCORP"
        ]
    }
    ```
    * `range` - Evaluates if the value stored in the field is in the range defined by a list specified in the value parameter. `value` must be an array of length two. The first value in the array will be treated as the start of the range.
    ```
    {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "operation": "range",
      "value": [250000, 1000000]
    }
    ```
    * `contains` - A case-insensitive containment test
    ```
    {
      "field": "recipient__name",
      "operation": "contains",
      "value": "BOEING"
    }
    ```
    * `contained_by` - A special operation for array fields; matches where the value of the field is entirely contained by the specified array.
    ```
    {
      "field": "business_categories",
      "operation": "contained_by",
      "value": ["local_government", "woman_owned_business"]
    }
    ```
    * `overlap` - A special operation for array fields; matches where the value of the field has any overlap with the specified array.
    ```
    {
      "field": "business_categories",
      "operation": "overlap",
      "value": ["local_government"]
    }
    ```
    * `length_greater_than` and `length_less_than` - A special operation for array fields. As `less_than` and `greater_than`, but on the length of the data in the ArrayField.
    ```
    {
      "field": "business_categories",
      "operation": "length_greater_than",
      "value": "0"
    }
    ```
    * `is_null` - Evaluates whether the field is null or not null. `value` must be either `true` or `false`.
    ```
    {
      "field": "awarding_agency",
      "operation": "is_null",
      "value": false
    }
    ```
    * `search` - Executes a full text search on the specified field or fields.
    ```
    {
      "field": "awarding_agency__name",
      "operation": "search",
      "value": "congress"
    }
    ```
    **_or_**
    ```
    {
      "field": ["awarding_agency__name", "recipient__name"]
      "operation": "search",
      "value": "treasury"
    }
    ```
    * `fy` - Evaluates whether the field (in general, this should be a datetime field) falls within the federal fiscal year specified as `value`. `value` should be a four-digit integer specifying the fiscal year. An example of a fiscal year is FY 2017 which runs from October 1st 2016 to September 30th 2017. Does not need `value_format`, as this is assumed.
    ```
    {
      "field": "date_signed",
      "operation": "fy",
      "value": 2017
    }
    ```
    * `range_intersect` - Evaluates if the range defined by a two-field list intersects with the range defined by the two-length array `value`. `value` can be a single item _only_ if `value_format` is also set to a range converting value. An example of where this is useful is when a contract spans multiple fiscal years and you are trying to evaluate whether it overlaps with any one particular fiscal year --that is, whether the range defined by `period_of_performance_start` to `period_of_performance_end` intersects with the fiscal year.

    For example, if your `field` parameter defines a range as `[3,5]` then the following ranges will intersect:
      * `[2,3]` - As the 3 overlaps
      * `[4,4]` - As the entire range is contained within another
      * `[0,100]` - As the entire range is contained within another
      * `[5,10]` - As the 5 overlaps

    Mathematically speaking, ranges will intersect as long as there exists some value `C` such that `r1 <= C <= r2` and `f1 <= C <= f2`
    ```
    {
      "field": ["create_date", "update_date"],
      "operation": "range_intersect",
      "value": ["2016-11-01", "2016-11-02"]
    }
    ```
    **_or_**
    ```
    {
      "field": ["create_date", "update_date"],
      "operation": "range_intersect",
      "value": 2017,
      "value_format": "fy"
    }
    ```
  * `value` - Specifies the value to compare the field against. Some operations require specific datatypes for the value; these are documented in the `operation` section.
  * `value_format` - Specifies the format for the value. Only used in some operations where noted. Valid choices are enumerated below.
    * `fy` - Treats a single value as a fiscal-year range.
  * `combine_method` - This is a special field that modifies how the filter behaves. When `combine_method` is specified, the only other allowed parameter on the filter is `filters`, which should contain an array of filter objects. The `combine_method` will be used to logically join the filters in this list. Options are `AND` or `OR`.
  ```
  {
    "combine_method": "OR",
    "filters": [
      {
        "field": "funding_agency__toptier_code",
        "operation": "equals",
        "value": "0300"
      },
      {
        "field": "awarding_agency__toptier_code",
        "operation": "in",
        "value": ["0300", "0500"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### Response (JSON)
The response object structure is the same whether you are making a GET or a POST request. An example of a response from `/v1/awards/` is as follows:

```

### Response Description
An USAspending API v1 response has three functional parts:
  * `page_metadata` - Includes data about the pagination and any page-level metadata specific to the endpoint.
    * `page` - What page is currently being returned.
    * `has_next_page` - Whether or not there is a page after the current page.
    * `next` - The link to the next page of this response, if applicable.
    * `previous` - The link to the previous page of this response, if applicable.
  * `req` - The special code corresponding to this POST request. See [Post request preservation]("#post-requests-preservation") for instructions on how to use this
  * `results` - An array of objects corresponding to the data returned by the specified endpoint. This will _always_ be an array, even if the number of results is only one.

### Downloads

The endpoints described in this section generate files that reflect the site's underlying data.

#### Award Data Archive

On a monthly basis, the website pre-generates a series of commonly used files based on the agency, fiscal year, and award type. You can find these on the [Award Data Archive](https://www.usaspending.gov/#/download_center/award_data_archive) page. You can also access this information via the API's [List Downloads Endpoint](https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/bulk_download/list_monthly_files/).

#### Generating Download Files

**Reminder**: Before using these endpoints, check the  [Award Data Archive](https://usaspending.gov/#/download_center/award_data_archive) for pre-generated files

There are several downloadable endpoints, all with different features/constraints.

##### Row Constraint Downloads

These downloads have a row constraint on them, meaning there is a hard limit to the number of records to include (currently that limit is `500,000` rows). The main benefit of using these endpoints is that they allow various filters that are not supported by the Year Constraint Downloads.

To download transactions, please use [Advanced_Search_Transaction_Download](https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/download/transactions/).

To download awards, please use [Advanced_Search_Award_Download](https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/download/awards/).

##### Year Constraint Downloads

These downloads do not have a row constraint, but they are limited to a certain number of filters and the time-range filter is limited to `1 year`, at most. This allows you to download millions of rows for larger requests.

To download transactions and subawards, please use [Custom_Award_Data_Download](https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/bulk_download/awards/).

#### Checking the status of the Download Generation

The responses of these endpoints includes a `file_name`, which will be used to check on the status of the requested download. For example, the response will look something like this:
```
{
   ...
   "file_name":"5757660_968336105_awards.zip",
   ...
}
```

To check to see whether that request is complete, use the [Status Endpoint](https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/download/status/) using `5757660_968336105_awards.zip`. Once it's complete, you can follow the `url` provided in the status response to download your data.

### Summary Endpoints and Methods <a name="summary-endpoints-and-methods"></a>
  Summarized data is available for some of the endpoints listed above:

  * **/v1/awards/total/**
  * **/v1/transactions/total/**
  * more coming soon

  You can get summarized data via a `POST` request that specifies the following:

  * `field`: The field to be summarized (this supports Django's foreign key traversal; for more details on this see `field` in [POST Requests](#post-requests)).
  * `aggregate`: The aggregate function to use when summarizing the data (defaults to `sum`; `avg`, `count`, `min`, and `max` are also supported)
  * `group`: The field to group by (optional; if not specified, data will be summarized across all objects)
  * `date_part`: Applies only when `group` is a data field and specifies which part of the date to group by; `year`, `month`, and `day` are currently supported, and `quarter` is coming soon
  * `show_nulls`: Whether to display results where the `group` data or the aggregate field data is null. In effect, this sets `show_null_aggregates` and `show_null_groups` to true. Defaults to false.
  * `show_null_groups`: Whether to display aggregates where all the `group` data is null. Defaults to false.
  * `show_null_aggregates`: Whether to display entries where the aggregate is null.

  Requests to the summary endpoints can also contain the `filters` parameters as described in [POST Requests](#post-requests). **Note:** If you're filtering the data, the filters are applied before the data is summarized.

  The `results` portion of the response will contain the following:

  * `item`: The value of the field in the request's `group` parameter (if the request did not supply `group`, `item` will not be included)
  * `aggregate`: The summarized data

  To order the response by the items being returned via the `group` parameter, you can specify an `order` in the request: `"order": ["item"]`. To order the response by the aggregate values themselves, add `"order": ["aggregate]` to the request.

  For example, to request the yearly sum of obligated dollars across transactions for award types "B" and "C" (_i.e._, purchase orders and delivery orders) and to ensure that the response is ordered by year:

  POST request to `/transactions/total`:

  ```
  {
      "field": "federal_action_obligation",
      "group": "action_date",
      "date_part": "year",
      "aggregate": "sum",
      "order": ["item"],
      "filters": [
          {
              "field": "type",
              "operation": "in",
              "value": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
          }
       ]
  }
  ```

  Response:

  ```
  {
    "page_metadata": {
     "page": 1,
     "has_next_page": false,
     "next": null,
     "previous": null
    },
    "results": [
      {
        "item": "2015",
        "aggregate": "44948.00"
      },
      {
        "item": "2016",
        "aggregate": "1621763.83"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  To summarize a field using a foreign key and to order the response by the summarized values from highest to lowest:

  POST request to `/awards/total`:

  ```
  {
      "field": "total_obligation",
      "group": "place_of_performance__state_code",
      "aggregate": "sum",
      "order": ["-aggregate"]
  }
  ```

  Response:

  ```
  {
    "page_metadata": {
     "page": 1,
     "has_next_page": false,
     "next": null,
     "previous": null
    },
    "results": [
      {
        "item": "MO",
        "aggregate": "500000.00"
      },
      {
        "item": "DC",
        "aggregate": "485795.43"
      },
      {
        "item": "UT",
        "aggregate": "0.00"
      },
      {
        "item": "HI",
        "aggregate": "-2891.33"
      }
    ],
  }
  ```

### Pagination <a name="pagination"></a>
  To control the number of items returned on a single "page" of a request or to request a specific page number, use the following URL parameters:

  * `page` - Specifies the page of results to return. The default is 1.
  * `limit` - Specifies the maximum number of items to return in a response page. The default is 100.

  For example, the following request will limit the awards on a single page to 20 and will return page 5 of the results:

  `/v1/awards/?page=5&limit=20`

### Autocomplete Queries <a name="autocomplete-queries"></a>

Autocomplete Endpoints allow developers to include autocomplete functionality in user interfaces for the API. Only a few have been implemented thus far (notably `/awards/`).

These endpoints currently only support POST requests. Let's look at `/api/v1/awards/autocomplete`, which performs autocomplete requests against award records. Each autocomplete request requires at least an array of `fields` to search against, and a `value` to search for.


#### Options
  * `fields` - A list of fields to be searched for autocomplete. This allows for foreign key traversal using the usual Django patterns. This should _always_ be a list, even if the length is only one.
  * `value` - The value to use as the autocomplete pattern. It is typically a string, but it could be a number in uncommon circumstances. The search will currently _always_ be case insensitive.
  * `mode` - _Optional_ - The search mode. Options available are:
    * `contains` - Matches if the field's value contains the specified value.
    * `startswith` - Matches if the field's value starts with the specified value.
  * `matched_objects` - _Optional_ - Boolean value specifying whether or not to return matching data objects. Default: false.
  * `limit` - _Optional_ - Limits the number of query matches. Defaults to 10.
  * `filters` - _Optional_ - As on regular endpoint, filters the data before performing the autocomplete.

#### Example

##### Body
```
{
  "fields": ["toptier_agency__name", "subtier_agency__name"],
  "value": "DEFENSE",
  "mode": "contains",
  "limit": 100,
  "matched_objects": true,
  "filters": []
}
```

##### Response
```
{
  "results": {
    "toptier_agency__name": [
      "DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD",
      "DEPT OF DEFENSE"
    ],
    "subtier_agency__name": [
      "DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD",
      "DEFENSE HUMAN RESOURCES ACTIVITY",
