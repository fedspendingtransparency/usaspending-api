def update_awards(award_tuple=None):
    """
    Awards can have one or more transactions. We maintain some information
    on the award model that needs to be updated as its child transactions
    change. For example, an award's total obligated amount represents the
    summary of its transaction's obligated amounts. Another example is a
    series of fields (award type, awarding agency, etc.) that will always
    be set to the value of the Award's most recent transaction.

    This function keeps those awards fields synced with child transactions.
    Obviously the raw SQL is not ideal. That said, the complex update
    of award fields based on the earliest, latest, and aggregate values
    of the child transactions was problematic to do in a set-based way
    via the ORM. These updates do need to be set-based, as looping through
    and updating individual award records would be an ETL bottleneck.
