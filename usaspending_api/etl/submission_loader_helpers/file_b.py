def get_file_b(submission_attributes, db_cursor):
    """
    Get broker File B data for a specific submission.
    This function was added as a workaround for the fact that a few agencies (two, as of April, 2017: DOI and ACHP)
    submit multiple File B records for the same object class. These "dupes", come in as the same 4 digit object
    class code but with one of the direct reimbursable flags set to NULL.

    From our perspective, this is a duplicate, because we get our D/R info from the 1st digit of the object class when
    it's four digits.

    Thus, this function examines the File B data for a given submission. If it has the issue of "duplicate" object
    classes, it will squash the offending records together so that all financial totals are reporting as a single object
    class/program activity/TAS record as expected.

    If the broker validations change to prohibit this pattern in the data, this intervening function will no longer be
    necessary, we can go back to selecting * from the broker's File B data.
