    NOTE: This command is necessary to update award values in Elasticsearch that were modified in the
    recently closed submission period. Elasticsearch calculations for an award's Covid-19 spending
    values do not include data from a submission until its submission window's reveal date has been
    passed. Because an incremental load in Elasticsearch uses the award's update_date to determine the
    delta since it last ran, the award data will not be refreshed after a submission closes until it's
    update_date is touched. This command updates the update_date field on awards modified by the latest
    closed submission, so the Elasticsearch incremental load will include those awards. The command
    uses the external_data_load_date table to make sure each submission window is only 'revealed' once.
