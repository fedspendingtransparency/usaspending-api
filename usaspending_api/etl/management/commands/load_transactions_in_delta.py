        This command reads transaction data from source / bronze tables in delta and creates the delta silver tables

        "external_data_load_date" table in Postgres to determine the subset of transactions to load. For a full
        pipeline run the "award_id_lookup" and "transaction_id_lookup" levels should be run first in order to populate the
        lookup tables. These lookup tables are used to keep track of PK values across the different silver tables.

            "etl_level" set to "initial_run" to set up the needed lookup tables and populate the needed sequences and
