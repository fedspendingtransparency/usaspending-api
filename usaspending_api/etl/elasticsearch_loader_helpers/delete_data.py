    Bulk delete a batch of documents whose field identified by ``key`` matches any value provided in the

    NOTE: This delete routine looks at just the index name given. If there are duplicate records across
    multiple indexes, an alias or wildcard should be provided for ``index`` param that covers multiple
    indices, or this will need to be run once per index.

    Args:
        client: elasticsearch-dsl client for making calls to an ES cluster
        key: name of field in targeted elasticsearch index that should have a unique value for
            every doc in the index. The field or sub-field provided MUST be of ``keyword`` type (or ``_id`` meta field)
        value_list: if key field has these values, the document will be deleted
        task_id (str): name of ES ETL job being run, used in logging
        index (str): name of index (or alias) to target for the ``_delete_by_query`` ES operation.
        refresh_after: Whether to call ``_refresh`` on the index when all of the provided values in
            ``value_list`` have been processed for delete; defaults to ``True``. If many small deletes happen at a
            rapid rate, it may be best to set this ``False`` and await a deferred refresh afterward in the calling
            code. NOTE: This param will be ignored and a refresh will be attempted if this function
            errors-out during execution, in order to not leave un-refreshed deletes in the index.
        delete_chunk_size: the batch-size of terms value-array given to each _delete_by_query call. Needs to be
            less than 65536 (max values for any terms query), and less than index.max_results_window setting. Ideally
            use ``config["partition_size"]`` (derived from --partition-size) to set this to a calibrated value. If not
            provided, uses 1000 as a safe default (10,000 resulted in some timeouts on a busy cluster).
