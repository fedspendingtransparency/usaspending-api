"""
The entire purpose of this management command is to coordinate the transaction_delta table between
two databases:

    - a snapshot database from which monthly delta files are generated
    - a "live" database such as development, staging, or (most likely) production

Why do we need such coordination, you ask?  Well, while monthly delta files are being generated from
the snapshot database (which, as of this writing, takes longer than a day), transaction updates may
be performed in the "live" database.  Once delta files are successfully completed in the snapshot
database, we need to remove those records from the transaction_delta table in the "live" database.

So, in a nutshell, this function will delete transaction_delta records from the "live" database
with a created_at date <= the max(created_at) from the snapshot database.
