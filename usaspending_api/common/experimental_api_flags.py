Some API endpoints accept "X-Experimental-API" as a HTTP Header to control experimental API functionality.
The constants expected are defined in this file to insure consistency across different endpoints that may / will
need to have experimental functionality alongside the expected functionality as the changes are made permanent
in Production.

EXPERIMENTAL_API_HEADER - HTTP Header expected to access experimental functionality.
