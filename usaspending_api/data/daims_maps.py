"""
This is a map of code enumerations, extracted from the DAIMS.

Each should be named following this pattern:
    - For a field that is unique among all models, <field>_map
    - For a field that is not unique among models, <model_name>.<field>_map

Example 1: For the "action_type_description" field to be automatically updated, we create a map called
"action_type_map" because that field is unique among all models.

Example 2: For the "type_description" field to be automatically updated, we need to uniquely identify the maps on a
per-model basis as this field exists on multiple models, but cannot share enumeration maps. Thus, we will make two maps:
"Award.type_map" and "TransactionNormalized.type_map".

Each map has a key of enumerable values, paired with the description field for that value.

There are a few special keys:
    _DEFAULT - A default value to use, if the incoming value is NoneType
    _BLANK - A value to use if the incoming value is blank

CASES:
If you have a need to specify a different mapping based upon other fields on the same model, you can do so by specify
cases. These must be numbered from 1, and store conditions in the "case_<INT>" and the mappings in "case_<INT>_map".
For an example, see TransactionNormalized.action_type_map
