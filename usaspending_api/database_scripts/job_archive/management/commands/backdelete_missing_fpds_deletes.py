"""
Jira Ticket Number(s): DEV-4941

    Delete FPDS transactions from USAspending that are no longer in Broker.

Expected CLI:

    $ ./manage.py backdelete_missing_fpds_deletes

Purpose:

    This script will simply delete all source_procurement_transaction and transaction_fpds
    records that are no longer in Broker.  Unfortunately, delete files have proven themselves
    to be unreliable so we're going to do this the old-fashioned way... diffing primary keys.
    The diffing has been pre-processed since diffing on the fly is not a quick process.  The
    pertinent detached_award_procurement_ids can be found in backdelete_missing_fpds_deletes.txt.

Life expectancy:

    Once Sprint 106 has been rolled out to production this script is safe to delete... although I
    would recommend keeping it around for a few additional sprints for reference.

    BE SURE TO ALSO DELETE backdelete_missing_fpds_deletes.txt WHEN YOU DELETE THIS SCRIPT!
