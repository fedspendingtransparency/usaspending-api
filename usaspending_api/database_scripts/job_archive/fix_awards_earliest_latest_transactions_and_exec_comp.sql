/*
Jira Ticket Number(s): DEV-3759

Expected CLI:

    $ psql ${DATABASE_URL} -a -f usaspending_api/database_scripts/job_archive/fix_awards_earliest_latest_transactions_and_exec_comp.sql

Purpose:

    Update awards where the earliest transaction, latest transaction, or officers is incorrect
    according to new sorting algorithm.

Life expectancy:

    Once Sprint 94 has been rolled out to production this script is safe to delete... although I
    would recommend keeping it around for a few additional sprints for reference.
