"""
Jira Ticket Number(s): DEV-8828

    Created new fields on Transaction Normalized and Awards for both the value of each transaction's
    "indirect_federal_sharing" amount and the sum of all amounts under an award, respectively.

Expected CLI:

    $ python3 usaspending_api/database_scripts/job_archive/backfill_fabs_indirect_federal_sharing.py

Purpose:

    Populate the FABS "indirect_federal_sharing_value" onto the Transaction Normalized record and add the sum
    to the Award record.
