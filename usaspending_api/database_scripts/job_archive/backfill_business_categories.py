"""
Jira Ticket Number(s): DEV-3753

    Move business_categories from legal_entity to transaction_normalized.

Expected CLI:

    $ python3 usaspending_api/database_scripts/job_archive/backfill_business_categories.py

Purpose:

    Recalculate business categories for all transactions.  We COULD just copy them from legal_entity,
    but I'd sleep better at night knowing we were getting a fresh start even though it'll take
    longer to update them this way.

Life expectancy:

    Once Sprint 95 has been rolled out to production this script is safe to delete... although I
    would recommend keeping it around for a few additional sprints for reference.
