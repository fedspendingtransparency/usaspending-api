class HistoricalAppropriationAccountBalances(models.Model):
    """
    This table is a work in progress to support new Agency 2.0 functionality on the USAspending
    website.  It is based on a one time dump of GTAS File A data and contains data similar to, but
    not quite the same as, data in the AppropriationAccountBalances and TreasuryAppropriationAccount
    tables which are loaded from a regular GTAS feed (via Broker).

    The decision was made to keep this data separate for now for reasons including, but not
    limited to:

        - The data points we have received are ever so slightly different than those received from
          our regular feed.
        - This table will likely require several tweaks/refactors/reloads as we receive new dumps
          during the feature development cycle.
        - Combining this with AppropriationAccountBalances would risk desynchronizing us from Broker
          which would be bad.

    NOTE:  If/when we decide to keep this table, we will want to add another step to the
    load_reference_data management command to bootstrap values into this table.  I am intentionally
    skipping this step for now as this is a transitional table that is not currently being used and
    the source data for which will be changing.  It is being added to assist with feature development
    and to provide a jumping off point for future loads; no sense re-inventing the wheel each time
    we get a new load.
