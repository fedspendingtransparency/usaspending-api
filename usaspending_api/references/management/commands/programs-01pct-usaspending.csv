Biomass Crop Assistance Program,10.087,(BCAP),"Farm Service Agency, Department of Agriculture","Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010, Title 1, Part Chapter 1, Section 101, Public Law 111-212; The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, Title IX, Section 9001, Public Law 110-246; The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, Title IX, 7 U.S.C 8101.","The purpose of BCAP is to encourage the production of biofuels.  BCAP accomplishes this by providing funding for agricultural and forest land owners and operators to receive matching payments for certain eligible material sold to qualified biomass conversion facilities for conversion to heat, power, bio based products, or advanced biofuels.  It also provides funding for producers of eligible crops of renewable biomass within specified project areas to receive establishment payments and annual payments.",Direct Payments with Unrestricted Use,"BCAP is intended to encourage the production of biofuels by assisting agricultural and forest land owners and operators with the establishment and production of eligible crops in selected project areas for conversion to bioenergy, and with the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facilities.","To be eligible to enter into a BCAP contract for the purposes of receiving an annual payment or establishment payments, a person or legal entity must be an owner, operator, or tenant of eligible land within a project area.  Eligible land must be agricultural land or nonindustrial private forest land. Eligible agricultural land includes cropland; grassland; pastureland, rangeland, hayland, and other land on which food fiber, or other agricultural products are produced or capable of being legally produced for which a valid conservation plan exists and is implemented. Ineligible land is as follows: (1) Federal lands; (2) State-owned, municipal, or other local government-owned lands; (3) Native sod; and (4) Land that is already enrolled in CCC\x92s CRP, Wetlands Reserve Program, or Grassland Reserve Program.  Eligible crops for annual and establishment payments are renewable plant materials such as feed grains, other agricultural commodities, or other plants and trees, and algae; waste materials including vegetative waste, materials, such as woods wastes and wood residues, animal waste and byproducts, such as fats, oils, greases, and manure, food waste, and yard waste.  Ineligible crops are any crop eligible to receive payments under Title I of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (See 8-LP, paragraph 126 and 7-CN for Title I commodities); and  any plant that is invasive or noxious or has the potential to become invasive or noxious.  Eligible materials for matching payments include various types of renewable biomass collected or harvested directly from the land in accordance with an approved conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or an equivalent plan before transport and delivery to the biomass conversion facility.  Materials will only be eligible if USDA determines that there is no higher value use for that material within a reasonable distance of the biomass conversion facility.   

Matching payments are not available for the following products:
(1) Material that is whole grain from any crop that is eligible to receive; payments under Title I of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 or an amendment made by that title, including, but not limited to, barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, rice, or wheat; honey; or material that is mohair; certain oilseeds such as canola, crambe, flaxseed, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower seed, soybeans, sesame seed, and sunflower seeds; peanuts; pulse crops such as small chickpeas, lentils, and dry peas; dairy products; sugar; wool; and cotton boll fiber; (2) Animal waste and by-products of animal waste including fats, oils, greases, and manure; (3) Food waste and yard waste; and (4) Algae.

All eligible material must be harvested or collected directly from the land by the eligible material owner according to a conservation, forest stewardship, or equivalent plan and be separated from the higher value product before the point of delivery.  Woody biomass harvested or collected outside of project area contracts is limited to eligible material resulting from preventative treatments to address fire fuel load reduction, insect or disease outbreaks, or restore ecosystem health.  Woody biomass harvested or collected outside of project area contracts is limited to eligible materials that do not have an existing market for non-biomass use and cannot be co-mingled with higher product value materials.  Eligible material owner, for purposes of the matching payment, means a person or entity having the right to collect or harvest eligible material, who has the risk of loss in the material that is delivered to an eligible facility and who has directly or by agent delivered or intends to deliver the eligible material to a qualified biomass conversion facility, including: (1) For eligible material harvested or collected from private lands, including cropland, the owner of the land, the operator or producer conducting farming operations on the land, or any other person designated by the owner of the land; and (2) For eligible material harvested or collected from public lands, a person having the right to harvest or collect eligible material pursuant to a contract or permit with the US Forest Service or other appropriate Federal agency, such as a timber sale contract, stewardship contract or agreement, service contract or permit, or related applicable Federal land permit or contract, and who has submitted a copy of the permit or contract authorizing such collection to CCC.  Eligible facilities are biomass conversion facilities that convert or propose to convert renewable biomass into heat, power, bio based products, or advanced biofuels and have been approved for the BCAP program by the CCC.","Owners and operators of agricultural and non-industrial private forest land will receive the ultimate benefits because it will provide financial assistance to establish, produce, and deliver biomass feedstocks.  Eligible material owners who are the person or entity having the right to collect or harvest eligible material, who has the risk of loss in the material that is delivered to an eligible facility and who has directly or by agent delivered or intends to deliver the eligible material to a qualified biomass conversion facility.","In order to enroll  land in BCAP, the participant must enter into a contract with the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).  Acceptance or rejection will be at the sole discretion of CCC, and offers may be rejected for any reason as determined appropriate to accomplish the purposes of BCAP.  Contracts will be for a term of up to five years for annual and non-woody perennial crops and 15 years for woody perennial crops; or time period may vary due to type of crop, agronomic conditions, and other factors.  Eligible material owner who enter into a contract with CCC may receive matching payments up to a period of two-years following the first payment for the delivery of eligible material to a qualified biomass conversion facility. This program is excluded from coverage under 2 CFR 200, Subpart E - Cost Principles.","FSA prepared a Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for BCAP and NOFA and was published in the Federal Register on June 25, 2010 (75 FR 36386).  On September 15, 2011, FSA published the BCAP interim rule (76 FR 56949).  The BCAP interim rule provided FSA with the authority to prioritize establishment and annual payments (BCAP project areas) and if sufficient funding remains, to consider applications for matching payments.   The interim rule also enables prioritization among project area proposals if eligible requests exceed available funding. Future funding for BCAP could make such prioritizing unnecessary. An environmental impact statement is required for this program. This program is excluded from coverage under E.O. 12372.","This program is excluded from coverage under 2 CFR 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. In order for a delivery of eligible materials to a biomass conversion facility to qualify for a BCAP payment, the receiving biomass conversion facility must be qualified for BCAP. To become qualified, the biomass conversion facility must enter into an agreement with CCC, through the FSA State office in the State where the facility is physically located.  For any facility, whether or not yet in operation, the entity requesting that a facility become qualified must provide proof of all applicable Federal, State, local, and Tribal permits and licenses required for operation or proof of application completions or letters of renewal submissions from the applicable governmental entity. Applicable permits and licenses may include, but are not limited to, business licenses, air quality permits, water discharge permits, storm water permits, or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives registrations.  Each biomass conversion facility must enter into a separate agreement with CCC regardless of whether a single owner has multiple facilities. CCC will issue a unique facility identification number to each qualifying biomass conversion facility.  Eligible material owners must apply at an FSA county office and receive approval for that application before delivering the eligible material to the qualified biomass conversion facility.  Applications must include the following based on information obtained from contracts, agreements, or binding letters of intent: (1) An estimate of the total dry tons of eligible material expected to be sold to the qualified biomass conversion facility; (2) The type(s) of eligible material that is expected to be sold; (3) The name of the qualified biomass conversion facility that will purchase the eligible material; (4) The expected, fair market, per dry ton payment rate the owner plans to receive for the delivery of the eligible material; (5) The date or dates the eligible material is expected to be delivered to the qualified biomass conversion facility; (6) A new or amended conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan.  Eligible material owners who deliver eligible material to more than one qualified biomass conversion facility must submit separate applications for each facility to which eligible material will be delivered.  In order to enroll land for Establishment and Annual payments, the participant must enter into a contract with CCC. Only the owners, operators, or tenants of eligible land within a project area that will actually perform the work specified in the contract are eligible to apply for the program.  The contract is comprised of: (1) The terms and conditions for participation in BCAP; (2) The conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan; and (3) Any other materials or agreements determined necessary by CCC.","Contract approval for matching payments is subject to availability of funds and to eligible material owners completion of required conservation plan, forest stewardship plan or equivalent plan; presentation of proof of material ownership; and compliance with all eligible material provisions.  Eligible material owners accepted into the program will receive their matching payments after they provide CCC documentation of deliveries to qualified biomass conversion facilities.    Establishment payments will be made based on a determination by CCC that an eligible practice or an identifiable portion exists.  Eligible practices are practices specified in the conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan that meet all standards need to cost-effectively establish annual crops, non-wood perennial crops, and wood perennial crops.  Payments will not be more than 75 percent of the cost for establishing a perennial crop for seed and stock costs; planting costs, cost of site preparation for non-industrial forest land; could include but not limited to site preparation for non-tree planting and supplemental or temporary irrigation.  Annual payments will be calculated on a per acre basis using market-based rental rates.  Rental payment rates will be based on average soil rental rate for cropland and all other agricultural land; marginal pastureland; and for forest land.  The first years' payments will be made as an advance in an amount equal to 50 percent with 30 days of contract approval, with the remaining 50 percent being paid within 30 days of the first-year contract anniversary date.  Annual payments for subsequent years will be made within 30 days of the contract anniversary beginning with the second-year contract anniversary.  If BCAP participants collect both annual and matching payments for their crops, they are subject to a reduction in their annual payment.  The size of the reduction depends on the end use of the biomass being delivered to a biomass conversion facility.  The annual payment will be reduced by:  1 percent if the eligible crop is delivered to a biomass conversion facility for conversion to cellulosic biofuels as defined by 40 CFR 80.1401; by 10 percent if the eligible crop is delivered to a biomass conversion facility for conversion to advanced biofuels; and by 25 percent if the eligible crop is delivered to a biomass conversion facility for conversion to heat, power, or biobased products.","Contact the headquarters or regional office, as appropriate, for application deadlines.",Not Applicable.,Determinations may be appealed in accordance with the administrative appeal regulations at parts 11 and 780 of 7 CFR.

The goal of the SRA program is to provide grants to support pollution prevention (P2), source reduction and/or resource conservation activities. The goal of the RP2INC program is to fund an organization which will serve as the national coordinator of the Regional P2 Resource Exchange Centers. The national coordinator will provide leadership in: framing national P2 initiatives, strengthening collaboration among the regional centers, evaluating P2 information, tools and products, and marketing the centers' services nationally. 


For purposes of the grant programs, P2 is defined as any practice which reduces or eliminates the creation of pollutants through: increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or other resources, or protection of natural resources by conservation activities. EPA is interested in funding projects which assist in reducing hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants entering waste streams or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal. Grant activities may involve, but are not limited to the following: equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, inventory control, etc.

Fiscal Year 2015: To support source reduction, pollution prevention and resource conservation activities that comply with the statutory authorities of the Clean Air Act, Section 103(b), as amended; Clean Water Act, Section 104(b)(3), as amended; Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, Section 20, as amended; Safe Drinking Water Act, Section 1442 (a)(1) and (c), as amended; Solid Waste Disposal Act, Section 8001(a), as amended; and the Toxic Substances Control Act, Section 10, as amended. 

Projects must consist of activities within the statutory terms of these EPA grant authorities. The statutes authorize grants for the following activities: 'research, investigations, experiments, education/training, demonstrations of new or innovative techniques, surveys and studies.' These activities relate generally to the gathering or transferring of information or advancing awareness. Applicants should emphasize this 'learning' concept in their proposals. All activities in the proposal must be eligible under one or more of the statutory authorities.

Fiscal Year 2017: SRA assistance agreements must carry out activities within the terms of EPA's statutory authorities. The statutes authorize the agency to award grants or cooperative agreements using methods of: research, investigations, experiments, education, training, surveys, studies and/or demonstration of innovative techniques. SRA assistance agreement activities must relate to gathering or transferring information or advancing awareness. Proposals must emphasize this 'learning' concept, as opposed to 'fixing' an environmental problem using a well-established method.

For projects that will support demonstration activity, the project must involve new or experimental technologies, methods, or approaches, where the results of the project will be disseminated so that others can benefit from the knowledge gained in the demonstration project. A project that is accomplished through the performance of routine, traditional, or established practices, or a project that is simply intended to carry out a task rather than transfer information or advance the state of knowledge, however worthwhile the project might be, is not a demonstration. The applicant must clearly explain in the proposal how the pollution prevention technologies, methods, or approaches used are new or experimental and how the project otherwise meets the requirements of a demonstration as described in the applicable RFP. If your project uses technologies, methods or approaches that have been used previously in other geographic areas and/or business sectors, then your proposal must include an explanation as to how your demonstration project is different from such prior projects and is a true demonstration. The applicant must also explain what will be learned in the industry from the demonstration project. If your project is truly a demonstration and complies with other eligibility factors then it will be considered for funding. 

Proposals that principally support recycling, clean-up, treatment, disposal and/or energy recovery efforts (e.g., incinerating solid waste to generate electricity) will not be considered for funding.",PROJECT GRANTS,"EPA is interested in supporting P2, source reduction and resource conservation projects that will provide an overall benefit to the environment by preventing pollutants at the source. Source reduction projects can include but are not limited to: 1) improving facility and institutional operations that reduce pollutant use and exposure, 2) reformulating and procuring products to reduce toxic constituents, 3) providing direct technical assistance to businesses and other organizations, 4) encouraging green product design and manufacturing, 5) conducting outreach, 6) collecting and analyzing P2 data, and 7) integrating P2 concepts into state, regional and tribal environmental multimedia programs. Grant activities must be consistent with the grant guidelines of the statutory authorities listed for this program. The statutory authorities are listed in this CFDA announcement and in the applicable grant solicitations. The statutes authorize EPA to award assistance agreements to support the following activities: 'research, investigations, experiments, education/training, demonstrations of new or innovative techniques, surveys and studies.' These activities relate generally to the gathering or transferring of information or advancing knowledge. Grant proposals should emphasize this 'learning' concept, as opposed to 'fixing' an environmental problem using a well-established method. For example, a proposal to install a more energy efficient heating system in the applicant's facility in order to conserve energy, would not, in itself fall within research, studies, demonstrations and would be viewed as a well-established solution not eligible for grant funding. All activities in the applicant's proposal must be eligible under one or more of the statutory authorities listed.
