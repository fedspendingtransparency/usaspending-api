# This file defines a series of constants that represent the values used in the
# API's "helper" tables. Rather than define the values in the db setup scripts
# and then make db calls to lookup the surrogate keys, we'll define everything
# here, in a file that can be used by the db setup scripts *and* the application
# code.
