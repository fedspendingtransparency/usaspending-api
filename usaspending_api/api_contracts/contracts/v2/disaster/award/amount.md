# Data Structures

## Filter (object)
+ `def_codes` (required, array[DEFC], fixed-type)
+ `award_type_codes` (optional, array[AwardTypeCodes], fixed-type)
    When Award Type Codes are provided, results are only returned if the awards are linked between Financial Account by Awards and Awards (File C to File D linkage).
    If this filter isn't provided then the results are File C (Financial Account by Awards) only
    This is mutually exclusive from `award_type`
+ `award_type` (optional, enum[string], fixed-type)
    When provided, it will return results limiting to the award type (Assistance or Procurment) based on Financial Account data.
    This is mutually exclusive from `award_type_codes`
