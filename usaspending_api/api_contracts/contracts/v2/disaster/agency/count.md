# Data Structures

## Filter (object)
+ `def_codes` (required, array[DEFC], fixed-type)
+ `award_type_codes` (optional, array[AwardTypeCodes], fixed-type)

    If this parameter provided, count will be calculated form the distinct set of toptier agencies, whose subtier agencies funded awards linked to FinancialAccountsByAwards records (which are derived from DABS File C) related to the provided DEF codes.

    If this parameter is not provided count will be calculated from the distinct set of toptier agencies "owning" appropriations accounts used in funding this disaster (from FinancialAccountsByProgramActivityObjectClass records, which are derived from DABS File B).

## DEFC (enum[string])

When filtering on `award_type_codes` this will filter on File D records that have at least one File C with the provided DEFC
and belong to CARES Act DEFC.
