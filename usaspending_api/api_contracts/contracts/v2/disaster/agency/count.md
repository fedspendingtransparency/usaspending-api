+ `award_type_codes` (optional, array[AwardTypeCodes], fixed-type)

    If this parameter provided, count will be calculated form the distinct set of toptier agencies, whose subtier agencies funded awards linked to FinancialAccountsByAwards records (which are derived from DABS File C) related to the provided DEF codes.

    If this parameter is not provided count will be calculated from the distinct set of toptier agencies "owning" appropriations accounts used in funding this disaster (from FinancialAccountsByProgramActivityObjectClass records, which are derived from DABS File B).

## DEFC (enum[string])

A list of current DEFC can be found [here.](https://files.usaspending.gov/reference_data/def_codes.csv)
