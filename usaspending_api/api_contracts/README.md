# API Contracts

## For Everyone
All new API endpoint documentation must be in markdown that conforms to the [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) syntax.


## For Developers
See [Tools for Testing and Mocking](tools-for-contracts.md)

## Guidelines to Remember when Writing Contracts
1. One endpoint per markdown file
1. Endpoints that are different HTTP methods can share one markdown file
1. Markdown filenames should be in snake_case
1. Folder structure should mimic the URL and use "snake_case"
    - Mimic the URL path after `api/`
    - Currently, API Contracts are not being written for v1 endpoints
1. Don't include example values in the response objects
1. Escape all items represented as strings by JSON with backticks: "\`"
    - This avoids issues with special characters and helps with consistency
    - This includes all keys and string values
