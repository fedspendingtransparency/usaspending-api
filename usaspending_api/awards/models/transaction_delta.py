"""
This model was originally created to satisfy DEV-2417:

    As a data re-purposer, I need monthly delta files to also include transactions which
    were added/modified by appropriate data change operation scripts so that the delta
    files keep me in sync with USAspending.gov data.

TransactionDelta (transaction_delta) is used to track transaction records that have been
created/updated outside of the nightly pipeline.  These are most likely to be one-time
data updates/corrections which would otherwise not be captured by the monthly delta process.

To use this table, simply record the transaction_normalized.id of the offending transaction
and the current timestamp (created_at).  If said transaction already exists, update it with
a fresher timestamp.

The monthly delta process will handle the rest.
