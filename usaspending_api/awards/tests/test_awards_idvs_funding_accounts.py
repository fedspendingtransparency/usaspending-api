        request is the Python dictionary that will be posted to the endpoint.
        expected_response_parameters are the values that you would normally
            pass into _generate_expected_response but we're going to do that
            for you so just pass the parameters as a tuple or list.
        expected_status_code is the HTTP status we expect to be returned from
            the call to the endpoint.

        Because this endpoint uses the same shared SQL as the roll-up endpoint and simply adds a group-by clause,
        it is not necessary to test the aggregation again, as any adjustment to the aggregation SQL that is incorrect
        would cause the Rollup Test cases to fail first anyway.
