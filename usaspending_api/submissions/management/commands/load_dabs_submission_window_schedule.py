"""
NOTE: "Reveal Date" (dabs_submission_window_schedule.submission_reveal_data) is stored as the 0th
second of the day (in UTC time) on which queries surfacing data submitted for this submission
window should allow the data to be displayed. i.e. if the current date (now() in UTC) is greater
than or equal to this date and time, show the data related to this submission. If not, don't show it.

The reveal date is originally set to a future date '9999-12-31'. When a schedules respective
submission_due_date (submission_due_date for monthly and certification_deadline for quarterly) has
been passed its reveal date is set to the current datetime by the 'reveal_dabs_submission_window_schedule'
command. Any reveal dates on schedules with a 'due date' in the past are not updated.

It is logically intended to be the "next day" after the DABS submission deadline communicated to
Agency Submitters. That deadline is exactly midnight Pacific Time on the schedule communicated to
Agency Submitters as part of the DAIMS documentation.

For simplification, Broker data in the submission_window_schedule table only stores the UTC date
part (with zeroed-time) of the above deadline.

Therefore we take the "reveal date" here to be the same date and time of the given deadline in the
broker table, since that achieves the logical intention of revealing data "the next day" after the
deadline communicated to Agency Submitters.
